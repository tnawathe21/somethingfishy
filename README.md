# Welcome to Something Fishy!

Our animation is a character-development scene with our main character, the orange fish. The camera focuses on our orange fish throughout the scene.

The story starts with the camera zooming in from outside the fish bowl to the scene inside. We see our fish swimming around playfully. The camera zooms into just our fish. Then it zooms out just enough to show the crab in the cave. The main fish swims up to the crab out of curiosity. The crab scares the fish. The fish gets scared and swims away. Hungry from terror, the fish is fed. Food particles fall into the fish bowl and our fish eats his fill. Once the fish is fed, it swims around a little more and encounters a big scary fish. The fish is scared but stands its ground. The big fish soon swims away, realizing he's no match for our orange fish. The end! The user can have the main fish blow bubbles at any time during the scene.
