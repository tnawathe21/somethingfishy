# Welcome to Something Fishy!

Our animation is a character-development scene with our main character, the orange fish. The camera focuses on our orange fish throughout the scene.

The story starts with the camera zooming in from outside the fish bowl to the scene inside. We see our fish swimming around playfully. The camera zooms into just our fish. Then it zooms out just enough to show the crab in the cave. The main fish swims up to the crab out of curiosity. The crab scares the fish. The fish gets scared and swims away. Hungry from terror, the fish is fed. Food particles fall into the fish bowl and our fish eats his fill. Once the fish is fed, it swims around a little more and encounters a big scary fish. The fish is scared but stands its ground. The big fish soon swims away, realizing he's no match for our orange fish. The end! The user can have the main fish blow bubbles at any time during the scene, and when is zoomed out, can change the color of the coral by clicking on it. 

# Main Features

* Custom made objects: all of our creatures and scenery objects were created from scratch (essentially our entire animation), using primitive shapes.
* Shadows: our zoom-in scene into the fishbowl includes calculated shadows (with light source, depth texture) for the fishbowl, the table, the small fish, and the big fish. 
* Mouse clicking interaction: when our scene is zoomed out, the user can click on the coral to change its color from pink to blue, and vice versa!
* Collision Detection: food particles disappear in the proximity of the fish during the feeding scene.
* Fish motion animation and camera blocks: our animation utilized many camera perspective changes for our various scenes, and the fish motion was modeled accordingly. One of our favorite scenes with camera perspective changes is the zoom in to the fishbowl in the beginning!
* User interaction: the user can press "b" or click the button on screen to blow bubbles.
* Simple physics-based motion: for the bubbles rising to the surface and for the food particles falling into the bowl. 
* Background music: free downloaded music for our animation, available on tap of screen
